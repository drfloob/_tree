# Must Happen

 * Autogenerate API
 * Make errors explicit in the API.
 * parse vertex-edge representations

 * host benchmark page
 * npm distribution

 * Setup performance comparisons between libraries

 * test adjacency list with root siblings.
 * test on NodeJS
 * get continuous integration setup for at least one environment
 * refactor random.spec.js into multiple files
 * ensure unique node ids after all operations on various trees
 * analyze test robustness, outline what needs better testing

# Nice-to-haves

 * (ask for and) collect test & benchmark stats.
 * implement tree plugins
   - red black tree
   - toposort
   - tarjan's offline LCA
 * implement a tree visualizer like [Jo√£o Nuno Silva's](http://jnuno.com/tree-model-js/) (his is neat!)
 * wire up some visual examples in jsfiddle
 * benchmark uuid vs _.uniqueId

# For the sake of meta awesomeness

 * analyze how the codebase would differ if javascript had
   type-safety, and static or dynamic type-checking
 * port to haxe; compare expressability, performance, and size.
 * see about emscripten or duetto for a C++ tree lib; compare size and
   performance.
