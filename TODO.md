# Implementation

 * Make errors explicit in the API.

# Support

 * build a simple supporting website
 * package and host test page
 * package and host docs
 * package and host benchmark page
 * (ask for and) collect test & benchmark stats.
 * `grunt release` impl
 * npm distribution

# Tests

 * spec: adjacency list with root siblings.
 * test on NodeJS
 * get continuous integration setup for at least one environment
 * refactor random.spec.js into multiple files
 * ensure unique node ids after all operations on various trees
 * analyze test robustness, outline what needs better testing

# Benchmarks

 * Setup performance comparisons between libraries
 
# Nice-to-haves

 * implement more tree builtin behaviors
   - balanced binary tree
   - red black tree
 * implement a tree visualizer
 * wire up some visual examples in jsfiddle
 * benchmark uuid vs _.uniqueId

# For the sake of meta awesomeness

 * analyze how the codebase would differ if javascript had
   type-safety, and static or dynamic type-checking
 * port to haxe; compare expressability, performance, and size.
 * see about emscripten or duetto for a C++ tree lib; compare size and
   performance.
